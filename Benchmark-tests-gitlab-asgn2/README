The Makefile:
	make copy: Copy changed files to correct position
	make all: build and install new kernel
	make benchmark: create benchmark executable file
	make clean: remove executable file

To switch between cases using sysctl:
	For case 1: sudo sysctl kern.sched.foo=1
	For case 2: sudo sysctl kern.sched.foo=2
	For case 3: sudo sysctl kern.sched.foo=3
	For case 4: sudo sysctl kern.sched.foo=4

Most of design doc finished when I joined the group
Worked on Case 2 portion of design doc

My Contributions:
	Implementing priority queue and combining priority with splatter for case 4
	Testing cases and comparing results
	Testing sysctl output
	Debugging case 4 and sysctl implementation
	General proofreading

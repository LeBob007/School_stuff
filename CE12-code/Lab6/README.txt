Lab 6: Musical Subroutines
CMPE 012 Summer 2018

-------------------------

What was your design approach?
First I separated each subroutine on its own and worked on each individually.
I copied over only the relevant test portions to test each step of the process.

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how subroutines and other files can interact with one another.
I also learned the importance of separating subroutines from a main file due to clutter.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
It was initially a bit difficult determining how I should go about this lab.
However, after going through in one subroutine at a time, the lab became much easier.
Understanding how syscall 33 worked and debugging my play note and play song methods was a bit more difficult.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
The lab works well but the duration is very bizzare.
Sometimes the notes don't flesh out fully when the rhythm is at 8 but when the rhythm is at 4, it performs better.

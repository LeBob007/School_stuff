What were the learning objectives of this lab?
The learning objectives of this lab was to understand how to make adders and registers in mml and how numbers are represented in logic systems.
Also, the lab helped students learn about some of the logic components and how they worked.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
Once I fully understand the structure of adders and registers, I found the lab very enjoyable.
Prior to that, I was troubled with how to structure the logical components as well as changing the display logic to fit 4 bits rather than 3.
I ended up building the logic circuits incorrectly and stumped myself.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
My main issue was that there were only two mml labs and that there was a visible difference in difficulty between Lab 2 and Lab 3.
I understand that becuase that this is the summer term, time is limited.
My suggestions would be to either add another mml lab in between or to help students better understand adders and registers.

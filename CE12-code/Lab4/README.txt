CMPE 012 Summer 2018

The text of your prompt (“Please input the start year:” and “Please input the end year:”) is stored in the processor’s memory. After assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which this string is stored?
They are stored in addresses from 0x1001000 to 0x1001001e.

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
The main learning objective of this lab was to help us get familiar with how MARS and MIPS work and to prepare us for future labs.
The lab also helped us understand how each function operated and the relationship between addresses.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
Getting used to the unique way of writing code is MARS took a while to understand.
Once I understood it though, the entire process was a lot more fun

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I think that the lab, in its current state, serves well to introduce MIPS and MARS to new students who may be unfamiliar with the program.
Perhaps adding more to the end of the lab and introducing another segment in a "part 2" section with a different goal might be beneficial.

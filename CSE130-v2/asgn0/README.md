and make spotless to remove all unnecessary files.
~~~
$ make spotless

#### Notes
Parts of the code and other files are copied from my old files from my previous CSE130 class. The main program is slightly modified given that in my last CSE130 class, the instructions for both the file itself as well as the specs of dog were slightly different.

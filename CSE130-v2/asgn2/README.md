#### Notes
Limited testing, code is pretty messy, some code is written with help provided in Michael's section as well as in Clark's section. Getting some segfaults in git tests but testing on my end seems to work fine. gdb doesnt seem to be showing are errors but that could simply be due to my unfamiliarity with gdb.
